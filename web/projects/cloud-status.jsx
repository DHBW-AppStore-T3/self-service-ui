// What the header has to know about the cloud section without opening it:
//
//   isRoot     whether to offer the Root Admin entry at all
//   pending    how many requests wait for this user's decision — the number
//              that used to be the reason for an "Approvals" tab. Without it
//              nobody learns that something arrived until they go looking.
//   hasBudgets whether the user manages a budget. The budget view is for
//              running budgets; somebody who only draws from them finds them
//              on "My Projects", and the entry is left out (see nav.jsx).
//   canRequestBudgets whether a budget offered to the user takes sub-budget requests (allow_sub_budget_requests): the budget view is where those are made and followed, so the entry is shown for them too.
//   offered    the kinds (cloud, workspaces, llm) a budget in reach (managed, or
//              one the user may request from) offers resources of. Without one,
//              the LLM or workspace section has nothing to offer somebody who has
//              no project there: the way to a project would lead nowhere.
//
// It lives above the header (see index.jsx) because the menu is rendered there,
// and the views below call refresh() after every decision so the badge follows
// what just happened.
